#This code will:
#	1. Check if an interrupt occured
#	2. If not, then continue as normal
#	3. Else it will load the context of the interrupting
#	   thread into r4-r9, and the ra into r17
#	4. It will then call mythread_scheduler
#	5. After returning, it will store the values or r4-r9
#	   back on the sp.  If a new thread was started then
#	   the values with be different.  Else they will stay
#	   the same.
